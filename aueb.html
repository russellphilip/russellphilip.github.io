								<p>During my Erasmus semester at the Athens University of Economics and Business from October 2021 to February 2022, I've embarked on an enriching academic journey that has expanded my horizons in myriad ways. Delving into a diverse range of courses, I've had the opportunity to explore various facets of economics and society, gaining invaluable insights into the complexities of our interconnected world. </p>

<p>One of the highlights of my semester has been the exploration of Business Strategy, where I've delved into the strategic decision-making processes that drive organizations forward. Understanding how companies formulate and execute their strategies in the ever-evolving global market has provided me with a solid foundation in navigating the complexities of modern business environments. </p>

<p>In the realm of International Trade, I've delved into the intricacies of global commerce, examining the factors influencing trade patterns, tariffs, and trade agreements. This course has not only deepened my understanding of the mechanics of international trade but has also shed light on the economic implications of globalization and trade policies on both developed and developing economies. </p>

<p>My academic journey has also led me to explore the intersection of economics and sociology, where I've gained insights into the social dimensions of economic phenomena. Understanding how societal structures, norms, and institutions influence economic behavior has been eye-opening, highlighting the importance of considering social factors in economic analysis and policy-making. </p>

<p>Moreover, studying the European Monetary Union has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with monetary integration. Analyzing the mechanisms of the eurozone and the implications of a common currency on member states' economies has deepened my appreciation for the complexities of the European economic integration efforts. </p>

<p>Additionally, delving into the nuances of Labor Economics has allowed me to grasp the intricacies of labor markets, employment dynamics, and labor market policies. Understanding the factors shaping wages, employment patterns, and income inequality has equipped me with a nuanced understanding of labor market dynamics and the broader socio-economic implications. </p>

<p>Beyond the academic realm, my time in Athens has been enriched by vibrant intercultural experiences. Engaging with fellow students from diverse backgrounds, exchanging ideas, and immersing myself in the rich Greek culture has broadened my perspective and fostered meaningful connections. Living and studying in Athens has not only expanded my academic horizons but has also enriched my personal growth, leaving me with cherished memories and a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of our global and European community.
