									<h1>University of Tübingen<br/> - <br/> Department of Public Economics</h1>
									<p>Through excellent research and teaching, the University of Tübingen strives to find solutions to the challenges of the future in a globalized society. With around 200 degree programs, the university offers a wide range of subjects. The Public Economics department hereby specializes in topics of public economics, international taxation, and applied econometrics under the leadership of Prof. Dr. Wamser. I supported the department as research assitant for six months.</p>

								<p>In my role as a research assistant, I provided vital support to the faculty by conducting in-depth analysis of data and data sources for future research endeavors. This involved not only analyzing firm's financial and taxation data using platforms such as BoardEx and Orbis but also undertaking crucial data management tasks. I was responsible for merging and cleaning datasets, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the information used for analysis. By meticulously organizing and preparing the data, I facilitated seamless analysis and interpretation, allowing for the identification of trends, patterns, and insights essential for informing future research directions. Additionally, I played a key role in presenting research findings and data possibilities to faculty members, contributing to informed decision-making and the development of impactful research projects. This multifaceted experience not only honed my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of the research process and its implications for academic scholarship. </p>

<p>Hereby, I also cultivated strong communication and presentation skills through regular interactions with faculty members and peers. From articulating complex data findings to synthesizing research implications, I learned to convey information clearly and persuasively, fostering effective collaboration and knowledge dissemination.</p>

<p>Overall, my tenure as a research assistant was instrumental in shaping my academic and professional growth, providing me with a solid foundation in research methodology, data analysis, and scholarly communication. These experiences have not only equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary for success in academia but have also instilled in me a lifelong passion for inquiry and discovery.
