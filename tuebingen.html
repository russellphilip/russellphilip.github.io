									<span class="date">Tübingen, Oct 2018 - Feb 2022</span>
									<h1>Ebhard Karls University</h1>
									<p>The Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen was founded in 1477, making it one of the oldest universities in Europe. The university has a long tradition and enjoys a high academic reputation both nationally and internationally, particularly in the fields of theology, medicine, law, economics and social sciences. In total, there are eleven Nobel Prize winners, five Humboldt Professorships and 18 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Award winners at or with links to the University of Tübingen. From October 2018 to February 2022, I completed the B.Sc. Economics and Business Administration program at the faculty founded in 1817 at this university.</p>

								<p>During the Economics and Business Administration program, I pursued a curriculum designed to foster strong analytical skills and a deep understanding of economic principles. With a particular focus on Public Economics and Econometrics, I engaged in coursework that explored the complexities of government intervention in markets and the empirical analysis of economic data. </p>
 
<p>For my final thesis project, I embarked on an in-depth investigation into the Panama Papers data, aiming to uncover potential links to tax avoidance practices. This endeavor required adept data management and analytical skills as I merged and analyzed vast datasets encompassing financial information and data on shell companies. </p>

<p>Throughout my degree, I benefited from a robust academic environment that encouraged critical thinking and rigorous research. Interacting with faculty members and fellow students provided valuable insights and perspectives, enriching my learning experience. </p>

<p>Outside of my academic studies, I actively participated in student societies such as Amnesty International. Engaging in these extracurricular activities allowed me to contribute to meaningful initiatives aimed at promoting human rights and social justice. These experiences not only complemented my academic pursuits but also reinforced my commitment to making a positive impact on society and help develop skills in leadership, communication, and teamwork. </p>

<p>Overall, my Economics degree equipped me with a solid foundation in economic theory, quantitative analysis, and practical research skills. It prepared me to navigate complex economic issues and contribute meaningfully to the field of economics and beyond.</p>
