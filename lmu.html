								<p>
Since commencing a Master of Science degree in Economics in October 2022, I have diligently explored various facets of the discipline. My academic endeavors have predominantly revolved around the fields of Public Economics, Behavioral Economics, and Industrial Economics. Engaging in rigorous coursework offered by esteemed institutions such as the ifo Institute for Economic Research, the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, and Ludwig Maximilian University, I have cultivated a comprehensive empirical skill set and practical acumen. This rigorous training has endowed me with the ability to meticulously analyze and evaluate public policies, discern the intricacies of political landscapes, and interpret market trends with precision and insight. </p>

<p>Moreover, my academic journey has been enriched by extracurricular activities and research projects. From participating in student-led seminars to discussing advanced research papers with faculty members, I have seized every opportunity to deepen my understanding of economic theory and its real-world applications. Examples for this are Behavioral Economics research on the effect of small gifts on expert decision making and Empirical Public Economic research on the value-added tax.  Additionally, I have actively sought out voluntary work to complement my academic studies, gaining firsthand exposure to organizing and funding social projects in developing countries. </p>

<p>Overall, my journey through the Master of Science program in Economics has been a transformative one, equipping me with the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to thrive in today's dynamic economic landscape. As I continue to pursue my academic and professional aspirations, I am confident that the foundation laid during my time in the program will serve as a springboard for future success and innovation.
